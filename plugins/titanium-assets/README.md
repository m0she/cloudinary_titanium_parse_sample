# CoffeeScript and LESS compiler for Titanium projects

A system to enable compiled sources easily with your Titanium projects.

Features:

* Incremental builds. It only compiles files that are new or have changed
* Does not package CoffeeScript or LESS source files with your Titanium binary
* No extra build steps to forget

## How it works
The system treats your project's Resources directory as a build target for compiled sources such as your .coffee files. The plugin hooks into Titanium's build system to compile only newly updated files without any extra steps.

## Setup
1. Rename your `Resources` directory to `Resources-static`
2. Add your CoffeeScript and LESS files into a new directory called `Resources-compile`
3. Create a directory called `plugins` and recursively copy the this project directory (`titanium-assets`) into it
4. To `tiapp.xml` add a plugins section if you don't already have one and register the `titanium-assets` plugin:

    &lt;plugins&gt;
    <span style='margin-left:2em'>&lt;plugin&gt;titanium-assets&lt;/plugin&gt;</span>
    &lt;/plugins&gt;

5. Recommended: Add your `Resources` directory to your .gitignore file (like you do with your build files)

The end result is a directory structure that looks roughly like:

    Project Dir
       |- Resources-static (*.js, images, etc)
       |- Resources-compile (*.coffee, *.less)
       |- plugins
          |- titanium-assets
             |- 1.0
                |- hooks

## Using it
Once you have your files in place, run a Titanium build as you normally would. Before the Titanium build takes place, the plugin will:

* Ensure you have a `Resources` directory
* Recursively copy all the files in `Resources-static` into `Resources` (maintaining directory structure)
* Recursively compile all the CoffeeScript and LESS files in `Resources-compile` into `Resources` (maintaining directory structure)

*Note: When you run a Titanium clean, the `Resources` directory will be completely removed.*

## Caveats
Things to keep in mind for this early version

* I've only tested in via command line builds
* I've only tested it on a Mac
* I've only tested it on my own projects
